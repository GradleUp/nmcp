### Inspect the deployment content

The `nmcpZipAggregation` task is an intermediate task of `publishAggregationToCentralPortal` that generates the ZIP file that is then sent to Maven Central.
You can use this task to inspect the entire content before publishing your project.

```bash
./gradlew nmcpZipAggregation
# the zip file is in build/nmcp/zip/aggregation.zip
```

Alternatively, you may publish to your Maven Local `~/.m2` repository using `nmcpPublishAggregationToMavenLocal`.

```bash
./gradlew nmcpPublishAggregationToMavenLocal
# the files are copied to ~/.m2
```
