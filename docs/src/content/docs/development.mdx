### Building the project

You can build the project locally by calling `./gradlew nmcpPublishAggregationToMavenLocal`.

> Note: calling `publishToMavenLocal` won't publish the Gradle plugin markers.

### Central snapshots

In addition to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/), you can use snapshots repositories to test the latest builds.

Central snapshots are available at `https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/`:

```kotlin
repositories {
  maven("https://central.sonatype.com/repository/maven-snapshots/")
}
```

### GradleUp snapshots

GradleUp snapshots are available at `http://storage.googleapis.com/gradleup/m2/`:

```kotlin
repositories {
  maven("http://storage.googleapis.com/gradleup/m2/")
}
```

Those snapshots are suffixed with the git sha1 (e.g. `1.4.3-SNAPSHOT-fee7f67ed80c3d08fc6860c8d05ccb0ce9795a20`). Their retention is 1 year.

Use them when you need reproducible builds and/or predictable retention.
